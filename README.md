## Cyber Matsu

[简体中文](README.CHS.md)

**This is a useless project that simulates throwing divination blocks using a physics engine (planck.js) and gives results.**

**Demo:** https://cybermatsu.i-am-cjc.tech

### Usage

1. Click anywhere on the screen to simulate throwing divination blocks.
2. The page will display the simulation results.

### Features

* Simulates the process of throwing divination blocks using a physics engine, providing a certain degree of randomness.
* Simple and clear interface, easy to use.
* This project is released with the approval of Matsu (LOL).

### Note

Due to the use of a 2D engine, it is impossible to perfectly simulate the real process of throwing divination blocks.

### Development

This project is built using Vite.

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/hutianyu2006/cyberMatsu.git

# Enter the project directory
cd your-repo-name

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Special Thanks

* **Physics Engine:** [planck.js](https://github.com/shakiba/planck.js)
* **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
